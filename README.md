### Project Overview 

The project aims to modernize and optimize the operations of Mr. Smith Johnson's medium-sized distributorship, which specializes in selling shoes, footwear, and accessories. Over the past five years, the business has experienced significant growth, resulting in an expanded inventory and customer base. However, the current manual record-keeping system is no longer sufficient to manage the increased workload efficiently. The project will focus on implementing digital solutions to address key business challenges and improve overall efficiency.
