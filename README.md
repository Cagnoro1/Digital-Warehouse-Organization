# Digital-Warehouse-Organization
Digital Organization of a shoe warehouse company with all the Information Systems needed to make the system work.

Mr. Smith Johnson has successfully operated a shoe distribution business for over 5 years, catering to local stores and individual shoe care providers. Despite increasing sales, the outdated manual record-keeping system using index cards and paper has led to issues like outdated customer information and order management difficulties. To address these challenges, we led the transition to a computerized system, employing Ishikawa diagrams, Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD), and Context Data Flow Diagrams (DFD) to design an automated solution. By selecting appropriate hardware and software, defining staff skill sets, and implementing procedures, we ensured efficient data management and improved customer service. Our efforts also included creating database tables, utilizing SQL queries for data retrieval, and developing a web-based interface, contributing to the long-term success and growth of Mr. Johnson's business.
